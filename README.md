# N26 category icons

A collection of exported icons from the N26 bank website/app.

Old icons are under `legacy` subfolders, and the new ones in the `modern` subfolders.

Unfortunatly, modern icons are available only as small PNG images. I can't find a way to fetch larger images or vector (SVG) variants and I really don't want to fuzz the N26 servers. Tried to contact N26, but without avail. 

If anybody has any ideas or a way to fetch SVG or larger bitmaps, please share.
